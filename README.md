# Scryviewer

Scryviewer is a Java application developed to explore and visualize **Magic: The Gathering** cards using the **Scryfall API**.  
It demonstrates a clean architecture approach while consuming external APIs and presenting data in a user-friendly way.

## Project Goals

- Practice HTTP requests in Java  
- Consume REST APIs (Scryfall API)  
- Display card information dynamically  
- Apply layered architecture (Repository + Service + UI)  
- Handle JSON parsing and exceptions properly  
- Organize code following SOLID principles  

## Technologies Used

- Java 25  
- HTTP Client (Java built-in)  
- JSON Parsing (Gson / Jackson)  
- Git & GitHub  

## Features

- Search for cards by name  
- Display card details: name, mana cost, type, oracle text, etc.
- Handle missing or optional fields gracefully  
- Formatted text output for readability  

## How to Run

1. Run the main application class
2. Type the card name to search and view results


## Concepts Practiced

- HTTP requests in Java
- JSON parsing and data mapping
- Clean code practices and modular design
